Speculative Köppen-Geiger Climate Classifier (skcc.py)
(c) 2018 Patrick Harvey [see the included LICENSE.txt]

skcc is a simple command-line tool intended for automating the process of using input temperature and precipitation data in image form to classify regions according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. It is aimed at speculative or fictional worlds and is designed to work with input data formatted in a way that is more feasible for creation by analysis or fiat rather than empirical measurement. As such, it is not strictly accurate to the climate classification system, as the input model does not support this; however, the goal is that it produces a reasonable approximation.

SETUP / DEPENDENCIES

skcc.py requires Python 3, with Pillow (https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) installed.

USAGE

The input data should take the form of four images of equal dimensions in RGB format (with no alpha or other additional channels). These images should represent temperature and precipitation for each of a winter extreme month and summer extreme month, respectively. These should be represented by the colors in the image - temperatures and precipitations should be colored according to a category, wherein temperatures and precipitations of a particular color will all be grouped together and assigned one value, which typically should be the average for the temperature or precipitation band the category represents. skcc should support multiple input file formats, although given the necessary color precision lossless formats are recommended. skcc has been tested exclusively using .png files. 

What colors represent what temperature/precipitation bands, as well as what color represents ocean, can be determined by providing input profiles as additional inputs, which map input RGB colors to temperature/precipitation averages. Temperature and precipitation use separate input color profiles; these are optional arguments for use if your input images do not match the default color categories used by skcc. Custom input color profiles can have more or fewer distinct temperature/precipitation bands than skcc uses by default.

Finally, when run skcc will take this input data and write to the provided output file name an image of identical dimensions to the input images, colored by Köppen-Geiger climate category. An output color profile can optionally be provided to determine what colors will be used as output for what climate categories. The file extension should be included in the output filename. Larger image sizes can take a bit of time to be processed (testing on ~4400x2200-pixel input images took approximately 20 seconds to complete).

Invoking skcc.py should generally appear as follows:

python ./skcc.py --tempns="JulTemp.png" --tempnw="JanTemp.png" --precns="JulPrecip.png" --precnw="JanPrecip.png" --outfile="output.png"

In particular, note that --tempns corresponds to the northern-hemisphere summer temperature, and --precns the north-hemisphere summer precipitation. Likewise, --tempnw is for the northern-hemisphere winter temperature and --precnw the northern-hemisphere winter precipitation. The filenames in the example should be replaced with actual filepaths to the input images. All of the arguments shown above are required to run the script. The format of the output image depends on the extension given in the outfile name.

The additional options for defining custom input and output color profiles are as follows, and are optional:

--tempprof="defaultTempProfile"

Defines "defaultTempProfile" as the filename from which to load the temperature input color profile

--precprof="defaultPrecProfile"

Defines "defaultPrecProfile" as the filename from which to load the precipitation input color profile

--outprof="defaultOutputProfile"

Defines "defaultOutputProfile" as the filename from which to load the output color profile

The proper format for the input and output color profile files can be seen in the included default files, which also contain explanations on how to construct custom versions of these. These files also describe the defaults used by skcc.py if no custom color profile is specified for any of the input/output categories.

The final optional command-line flag is --quiet. This disables the text output on completion ('Output climate map to...'). Note that error messages are not disabled by this flag.

NOTES ON KNOWN WEAKNESSES

The input model takes temperature and precipitation only for two extreme months of the year, which is more readily feasible to be hand-generated than twelve individual months. However, this means a precise classification for Cb/Cc and Db/Dc climate categories according to the Köppen-Geiger system cannot be done precisely by the definitions, and the output can be a bit inexact as a result regarding these particular category distinctions. Additionally, this input model means that (for example) regions whose annual precipitations are not well described via extrapolation by the mean of two annual extremes - or where precipitation and temperature extremes do not coincide temporally - can be misrepresented. As skcc.py is intended for classification on fictional worlds this can be less problematic than it is in trying to replicate real-world results based on real-world data, but these are particular notable cases and should be kept in mind.

The general classification process used by skcc.py is drawn from work by users Azélor and Charerg of the Cartographer's Guild (www.cartographersguild.com).
