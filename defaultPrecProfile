# This is the precipitation input color profile skcc uses by default.
# This file is just a sample; the program default does not reference it.
# Custom precipitation input profiles should use the format shown in this file.
# Lines beginning with '#' or consisting only of whitespace are ignored.
# All other lines should be of the form:
# <Name>:(<R>, <G>, <B>):<Val>
# Where <Name> is solely for readability and can consist of any characters besides ':'
# <R> <G> and <B> should be positive values in range 0-255, describing the color for this temperature
# in the input data. These can be fractional/include a decimal point.
# <Val> should be the average precipitation value for this category, in millimeters of precipitation. 
# For example, if a color denotes precipitation from 100mm to 200mm, <Val> in the color 
# profile for that color should be 150. 
# As a special case, <Val> can also be the character 'O' (not zero '0'), in which case that denotes an ocean color
# that will be ignored for climate classification and simply output as the output profile's ocean color. 
# Additionally, the entire RGB color for a row, e.g. (<R>, <G>, <B>), can be replaced with (Default), including
# the parentheses. In this case, all colors in the input temperature images that do not match any other
# color in the profile will be given the Default row's value. This can mean 'default-to-ocean', e.g. the row's <Val>
# field is 'O', as noted above.   
# Aribtrary whitespace can be placed around numbers, punctuation, and delimiters (:) provided each row remains a single line.
